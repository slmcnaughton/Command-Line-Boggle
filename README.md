# Command-Line-Boggle
Boggle is a word game designed by Allan Turoff and distributed by Hasbro. It involves a board made up of 16 cubic dice, where each die has a letter printed on each of its sides. At the beginning of the game, the 16 dice are shaken and randomly distributed into a 4-by-4 tray, with only the top sides of the dice visible. The players compete to accumulate points by building valid words out of the dice according to the following rules:

* A valid word must be composed by following a sequence of adjacent diceâ€”two dice are adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbors.
* A valid word can use each die at most once.
* A valid word must contain at least 3 letters.
* A valid word must be in the dictionary (which typically does not contain proper nouns).

This is a boggle game for the command line terminal.
